### Project Description

We propose to develop a service for a meal planning and recipe management  aimed primarily at college students and young adults. The service will allow users to manually enter recipes into their personal "cookbook" or add existing recipes from a public library. A "week planner" feature will enable users to plan meals for the week, generating a shopping list based on the selected recipes. Additional features like recipe rating, picture uploads, and recipe forking are planned. The service aims to solve the problem of meal planning and grocery shopping, making it easier and more efficient for people first living on their own. While the MVP will focus on core functionalities, future iterations could include AI-enabled inventory management and a premium feature set.
