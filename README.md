### Project Description

Open Recipes is a service for meal planning and recipe management aimed primarily at college students and young adults. The service allows users to create their own recipes or search for others' recipes using the search feature. The app also allows for the creation of recipe lists, which can group recipes together, e.g. "Breakfast". Users can view account information and pinned recipes from the 'profile' page. Finally, on the 'feed' page, popular and relevant recipes from the community are displayed for browsing!
