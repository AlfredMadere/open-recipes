1. Our first concurrency case occurs with ingredient names. There is a constraint in this column that all ingredient names must be unique - we would not want to have a bunch of different “eggs” in our database for example, as they are essentially all the same. If necessary, one could have eggs (pasteurized) and eggs (non-pasturized) for example if desired by the user to differentiate between different types of the same ingredient. We have an endpoint called post_ingredients where the user can add an ingredient to the database manually, by entering a name, type, storage_location, etc. We also have another endpoint called ??? where you can create a recipe by entering ingredients. If someone tries to hit this endpoint with ingredient N, while someone else tries to hit the create_ingredient endpoint with ingredient N, we run into a concurrency problem as both of these cannot successfully complete their calls with the same-named ingredient. 

2. Our second concurrency case occurs with ingredients names again. We have another endpoint called user_inventory, where a user can add ingredients to their inventory, aka their “fridge” in our api. As the user tries to add an ingredient to this inventory, as someone else tries to create an ingredient with post_ingredients, or create one through a recipe in ?????, we run into this similar naming concurrency problem. 

3. Our third concurrency case occurs with tag names. There is a constraint in this column that all tag names must be unique - we would not want to have a bunch of different “Mexican” in our database for example, as they are all the same. We have an endpoint called post_tags where the user can add a tag to the database manually, by entering the name of it. We also have another endpoint called ??? where you can create a recipe, and then give that recipe a tag in the same endpoint as you create it. If someone tries to hit this endpoint with tag T, while someone else tries to hit the create_ingredient endpoint with tag T we run into a concurrency problem as both of these cannot successfully complete their calls with the same-named tag.
